# Red Wine Quality Prediction

Here I play with the dataset by P. Cortez, A. Cerdeira et al., that contains data on chemical composition of the Portuguese red wine 'Vinho Verde'. My final goal is to build a model that will predict the quality of the wine from its chemical composition and classify the quality of the wine as good and bad, based on the input.

The project is simple. However, I did a little research on the wine composition features to retrieve some useful insights and build some new features;

I used plot.ly library to perform charts and plots in the EDA part. Those plots look astonishing in the Kaggle notebook environment, but don't render on GitHub. So if interested, check my Kaggle notebook first.

The models work good, but not perfect as the size of the dataset was the biggest issue. Note there is a slight overtraining in the models.
