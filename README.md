The project is simple. However, I did a little research on the wine composition features to retrieve some useful insights and build some new features;

I used plot.ly library to perform charts and plots in the EDA part. Those plots look astonishing in the Kaggle notebook environment, but don't render on GitHub. So if interested, check my Kaggle notebook first.

The models work good, but not perfect as the size of the dataset was the biggest issue. Note there is a slight overtraining in the models.
